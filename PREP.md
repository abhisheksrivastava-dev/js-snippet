Assessment Round

1. 8 mcq
2. build carousel
Managerial round 1 and 2:
It was majorly around past project, leadership principle, ownership.

Technical onsite round 3:
Interview was backend engineer at amazon
He started with short introduction then ask me design directory system just like Unix directory system.

Question - Directory might contains file with different extension (xml, json) or nested directory till n level of hierarchy.
Interviewer told me design interface how it looks like then follow up questions asked-:
1)	Find all file having xml extension
2)	Find all having size greater than 5mb.
then  If I want file having xml extension and size greater than 5 mb. how will you make your function reusable?
again some question based on principles.

went well

Technical onsite round 4:
Interviewer was SDE-I in amazon Started with introduction then jump to code editor

Question -: 
I have to display all images in UI that could filter based on tags (which are again dynamic in nature ).
And on click on any image model should display image title and image and date in MM/DD/YY format.
//Api
allImagesApi - [
{link : imageURl1, id:1, title: image1 tags:[nature, bird]},
{link : imageURl2, id:2, title: image12, tags:[nature], }],
]
ImageByIdAPI = {id:1, title: image1,toTake: "Date format" content: blabla, }

follow ups-

Interviewer told me to display all tags in form of checkbox and if I check multiple tags then images should be filtered on that basis.

Then comes to how will you handle event delegation (on each image or on parent container).

What is box model. and semantic element.

Then again question on their principle.

went well
